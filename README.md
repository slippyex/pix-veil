## üîç Techniques Explained

### Least Significant Bit (LSB) Steganography

LSB steganography involves modifying the least significant bits of image pixel values to embed hidden data without significantly altering the image appearance.

#### LSB Embedding Process

- **Data Preparation**: The secret data is compressed and encrypted.
- **Data Splitting**: The encrypted data is split into chunks.
- **Image Analysis**: PNG images are analyzed for embedding capacity based on tonal values.
- **Data Embedding**: Data chunks are embedded into the images using LSB manipulation.

### LSB Manipulation Illustration

*Example: Embedding Byte 0xDE into RGB Channels Using 2 Bits Per Channel*

We want to hide `0xDE` (which is `11011110` in binary) into the least significant bits (LSBs) of an RGB pixel, using 2 bits per channel.

#### Byte to hide:
- **0xDE** = `11011110`

Now, split this byte into three 2-bit parts:
1. **Red channel**: `11`
2. **Green channel**: `01`
3. **Blue channel**: `10`

#### Initial RGB Pixel Values:

Let‚Äôs assume the initial RGB values of a pixel are as follows (in decimal and binary):

- **Red**: 200 (binary: `11001000`)
- **Green**: 150 (binary: `10010110`)
- **Blue**: 100 (binary: `01100100`)

#### Modifying the 2 LSBs of Each Channel:

We will embed the 2 bits for each channel into the two least significant bits of the original pixel values.

1. **Red channel**: Embed `11` into the last two bits of Red (original: `11001000`):
    - Original Red: `11001000` (200)
    - Modified Red: `11001111` (207)

2. **Green channel**: Embed `01` into the last two bits of Green (original: `10010110`):
    - Original Green: `10010110` (150)
    - Modified Green: `10010101` (149)

3. **Blue channel**: Embed `10` into the last two bits of Blue (original: `01100100`):
    - Original Blue: `01100100` (100)
    - Modified Blue: `01100110` (102)

#### Final RGB Values After Embedding:

- **Red**: `207` (binary: `11001111`)
- **Green**: `149` (binary: `10010101`)
- **Blue**: `102` (binary: `01100110`)

These RGB values now contain the byte `0xDE` within their least significant bits.

~~~mermaid

        G1[Green: 100101*10* - 150]
        B1[Blue: 011001*00* -100]
    end

    subgraph Modified Pixel After Embedding 0xDE
        R2[Red: 110011**11** - 207]

        B2[Blue: 011001**10** - 102]
    end

    Byte[0xDE 11011110]
    Byte --> R2
    Byte --> G2
    Byte --> B2
~~~

**Explanation**:

- **Original Pixel Channels**: The original binary values of the pixel channels.
- **Bits to Embed**: The 2-bit groups from the byte `0xDE`.
- **Embedding**: Each 2-bit group is embedded into the least significant bits (LSBs) of the channels, following the channel sequence `RGB`.
- **Modified Pixel Channels**: The new binary values of the channels after embedding.

**Details**:

- **R1**:
    - Original: `1001 1010`
    - Embed `11` into LSBs:
        - Replace last 2 bits with `11`: `1001 10**11**`
- **G1**:
    - Original: `0110 1011`
    - Embed `01` into LSBs:
        - Replace last 2 bits with `01`: `0110 10**01**`
- **B1**:
    - Original: `1110 0101`
    - Embed `11` into LSBs:
        - Replace last 2 bits with `11`: `1110 01**11**`
- **R2**:
    - Original: `1010 1100`
    - Embed `10` into LSBs:
        - Replace last 2 bits with `10`: `1010 11**10**`

### Data Encryption

- **Algorithm**: AES-256-CBC.
- **Purpose**: Ensures that even if the embedded data is extracted, it cannot be read without the correct password.
- **Process**:
    - Generate a 256-bit key from the password using SHA-256.
    - Encrypt the compressed data with the generated key.
    - Prepend a random Initialization Vector (IV) to the encrypted data.

---

### Data Compression

- **Algorithm**: Brotli Compression.
- **Purpose**: Reduces the size of the data to minimize the impact on the carrier images.
- **Benefits**:
    - Fewer data to embed leads to less modification of the images.
    - Improves security by obfuscating the data patterns.

---

### Data Chunking and Distribution

- **Chunking**: The encrypted data is split into multiple chunks of variable sizes.
- **Distribution**: Chunks are randomly distributed across different images and positions.
- **Benefits**:
    - Increases security by scattering data.
    - Balances the load across multiple images to minimize distortion.

#### Distribution Map

- **Purpose**: Keeps track of where each data chunk is embedded.
- **Security**:
    - The distribution map is compressed and encrypted.
    - Embedded within one of the images using LSB.
- **Components**:
    - Chunk IDs.
    - Corresponding image filenames.
    - Start and end positions.
    - Bits per channel and channel sequence used.
